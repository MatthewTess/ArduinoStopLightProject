<br> -Arduino UNO board code for a pedestrian stop light with green, yellow, and red lights. The motion sensor is used to change colors for traffic; pedestrian button added to stop traffic when pressed  
<br> -Use PNG file to set up physical board, paste code into Arduino IDE, connect via USB cable, and designate Arduino board within the IDE  
<br> -Opening Serial Monitor can show the distance (with delay) of obstructions in front of the motion sensor
